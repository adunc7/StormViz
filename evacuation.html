        <h2>Category 4 - Hurricane Ian</h2>
        <p> Pre-storm, shelters should be near medical facilities, 
            food and water distribution centers, evacuation routes, 
            and communication hubs for quick access. Post-storm, 
            proximity to reopened medical services, emergency food/water supplies, 
            restored transportation, and communication systems is essential for recovery. 
            Access to emergency responders helps with both immediate and ongoing needs. 
            This ensures timely aid and smooth recovery during and after the hurricane. 
            Being close to critical services enhances safety and overall preparedness.
