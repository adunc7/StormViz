        <h2>Category 4 - Hurricane Ian</h2>
        <p> Hurricane shelters should be located on high ground, 
            away from coastal areas and flood zones, to avoid storm 
            surge and flooding. Sturdy, reinforced structures, 
            such as schools, community centers, or concrete buildings, are ideal. 
            They should be centrally located near population centers and evacuation 
            routes for easy access. Home shelters must be reinforced interior spaces 
            above flood levels, while public shelters should meet wind and flood safety standards. 
            Accessibility, ventilation, and sufficient space are essential for safety and comfort.
